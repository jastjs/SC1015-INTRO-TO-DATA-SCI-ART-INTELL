## Problem Definition
The data science problem that we have created is to:
1. Identify the drivers for each generations (1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s).
2. Observe if recession affects the resale prices for specific flat types and models (flat type - 3, 4, 5 room and executive + flat model - improved, new generation, model a, standard, simplified, maisonette and apartment).
3. Better analyse the factors which contributes to the increase of resale prices.

## Machine Learning Models
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression
