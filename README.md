## Problem Definition
The data science problem that we have created is to:
1. Identify the drivers for each generations (1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s).
2. Observe if recession affects the resale prices for specific flat types and models
* Flat Type - 3, 4, 5 room and executive 
* Flat Model - improved, new generation, model a, standard, simplified, maisonette and apartment
3. Better analyse the factors which contributes to the increase of resale prices.
 
So as to better perform financial planning when purchasing a resale flat.

## Data Cleaning
We have engaged a professional property agent to better understand the dataset that we are handling and have performed date cleaning for the following columns: 
* Individual Town to Region
* Combined Storey Range
* Sorted Years into Decades
* Calculation of Lease
* Cleaning of Flat Type and Flat Models
 
A text file(data_description.txt) has been created for detailed descriptions for each of the columns.
